# kafka-commando

[Get kafka from here](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)
- Have to extract and un tar the kafka version that we downloaded for that we need to git bash it in the C folder where we moved the kafka downloaded file.
 ```Bash
$ tar -xzf kafka_2.13-2.7.0.tgz
$ cd kafka_2.13-2.7.0
```
